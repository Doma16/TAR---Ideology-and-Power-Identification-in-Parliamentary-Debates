## Ideology and Power Identification in Parliamentary Debates

<p>
Debates in national parliaments do not only affect the fundamental aspects of citizens’
life, but often a broader area, or even the whole world. As a form of political debate,
however, parliamentary speeches are often indirect and present a number of challenges to
computational analyses. In this project, your focus will be on identifying two variables
associated with speakers in a parliamentary debate: (1) detecting their political ideology
and (2) whether they belong to a governing party or a party in opposition. Both subtasks
are formulated as binary classification tasks. The data for this task comes from ParlaMint,
a multilingual comparable corpora of parliamentary debates.
